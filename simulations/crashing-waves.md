## Simulation Phases

### **Phase 1: Awareness**
- **Scenario**:
  AI-based competitors enter the market, offering personalized products at lower costs and faster delivery.

- **Challenges**:
  - Leadership struggles to understand AI’s impact.
  - Employees fear job loss due to automation.

- **Actions**:
  - Host a board meeting with stakeholders to discuss AI’s relevance.
  - Engage consultants to evaluate organisational AI readiness.

---

### **Phase 2: Resistance**
- **Scenario**:
  Internal pushback from employees and leadership to adopt AI tools for production and decision-making.

- **Challenges**:
  - Cultural resistance to change.
  - Limited expertise in AI implementation.

- **Actions**:
  - Run a workshop simulating job roles enhanced by AI.
  - Explore low-risk AI applications in non-core functions (e.g., HR or marketing).

---

### **Phase 3: Adaptation**
- **Scenario**:
  Initial AI pilot projects show efficiency improvements, but scaling efforts reveal data quality and integration issues.

- **Challenges**:
  - Lack of clean, structured data for AI training.
  - Skepticism about ROI from senior leadership.

- **Actions**:
  - Develop a cross-functional AI task force.
  - Partner with tech vendors for phased integration.

---

### **Phase 4: Transformation**
- **Scenario**:
  Competitors fully embrace AI and capture significant market share, forcing the organisation to rethink its strategy.

- **Challenges**:
  - Need for rapid skill-building and upskilling.
  - Balancing traditional values with AI-driven innovation.

- **Actions**:
  - Transition to an AI-centric leadership model.
  - Introduce AI-driven product innovation labs.

---

### **Phase 5: Reinvention or Collapse**
- **Scenario**:
  The organisation either emerges as a leader in its niche or falls behind due to insufficient AI adoption.

- **Challenges**:
  - Maintaining long-term growth in an AI-dominated market.
  - Retaining brand identity amidst technological upheaval.

- **Actions**:
  - Measure outcomes of AI adoption initiatives.
  - Continuously iterate AI strategies to stay relevant.
