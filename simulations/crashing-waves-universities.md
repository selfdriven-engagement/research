# Navigating the Crashing Waves: AIâ€™s Impact on University Value

## Objective
Simulate how AI disrupts, enhances, or redefines the value of a university as an institution, focusing on its:
- Reputation
- Revenue streams
- Research priorities
- Faculty roles
- Student outcomes

## Scenario
The university is a metaphorical ship navigating a turbulent ocean of AI-driven transformation. The crashing waves symbolize the disruptive forces of AI, reshaping the university's standing in academia and beyond.

Key impacts to explore:
1. **Reputation**: AI-powered research and teaching affect the university's global standing.
2. **Revenue Streams**: Balancing traditional tuition income with AI-enabled opportunities (e.g., microcredentials, online learning).
3. **Research Value**: Shifting from traditional research to AI-enhanced, industry-driven innovation.
4. **Faculty Roles**: Balancing the roles of human educators vs. AI tools.
5. **Student Outcomes**: Ensuring graduate employability in an AI-dominated world.
